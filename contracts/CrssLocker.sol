/**
 * @dev CrssLocker contract locks the liquidity (LP tokens) which are added by the automatic liquidity acquisition
 * function in CrssToken.
 *
 * The owner of CrssLocker will be transferred to the timelock once the contract deployed.
 *
 * Q: Why don't we just burn the liquidity or lock the liquidity on other platforms?
 * A: If there is an upgrade of CrssSwap AMM, we can migrate the liquidity to our new version exchange.
